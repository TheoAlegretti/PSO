Optimise your fonction with birds ! 

Welcome to a new way to optimise your fonction. I put on this GitHub the thesis did with Baudrin Marie-Lou and Gruarin Serena for the Master 1 (econometrics and statistics) at the University of Paris 1 Sorbonne. I also give you the SAS code and my new Python work on it (Marie Lou did all the code : thanks to her) . 

I let you send me an email to this address : theo.lorthios@ensae.fr

Thanks for your reading !
